##Matrix-shooting mehtod finds eigenmode frequency and growth rate

This is set up for two concentric cylinders, their respective potential must be given as input. 
The inner cylinder also carries a current and hence, induces an azimuthal magnetic field.
Along with the potentials and the current, an equilibrium distribution must be given for which the 
diocotron frequency and growth rate should be calculated.
